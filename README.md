# Park Rides Visitor Management System

## Overview
This Java project implements a Park Rides Visitor Management System (PRVMS) designed to efficiently manage theme park rides and their visitors. It utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, including class inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces, along with collections like queues and linked lists for data management. The system supports ride queue management, visitor history tracking, sorting capabilities, ride cycle operations, and file I/O for data persistence.

## Features
Key features include a class structure for `Person`, `Employee`, `Visitor`, and `Ride`, with `Ride` implementing a `RideInterface` for managing operations. The system handles visitor queues, maintains ride histories, sorts visitors using a custom comparator, runs ride cycles, and supports exporting/importing ride histories to/from files.
